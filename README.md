# LIHKG Plus for Loon

A comprehensive Loon plugin to unlock premium features, remove ads, and enhance the browsing experience for the **LIHKG (連登)** app.

## ✨ Features

* **👑 Unlock Plus VIP**: Simulates Member Plus status with an indefinite expiry date (Year 9876).
* **👁️ True Sight (Vote Reveal)**: Forces the display of **Like/Dislike** counts in thread lists and comments, even if hidden by the server.
* **📊 Satisfaction Rate Visualization**: Automatically replaces category names with a **Satisfaction Rate** (e.g., "**85% **") calculated via `|Like - Dislike| / Total`.
* **🏷️ Smart Title Indicators**: Adds visual prefixes to thread titles for quick scanning:
    * 🔥 **Hot**: Trending topics.
    * 🆕 **News**: Detected via keywords.
    * ⚔️ **Controversial/Deep**: Long threads (>3 pages) or high-conflict topics.
* **🏆 "God Comment" Preview**: Automatically extracts the "hottest" sub-reply and appends it directly to the parent comment, saving a click.
    * **Color Coded**: 🟡 Thread Owner, 🔴 Female, 🔵 Male.
* **🔥 Smart Heat Sorting**: Sorts comments and quotes based on **"Heat"** (absolute engagement magnitude) rather than simple chronological order or raw likes.
* **🔓 Anti-Censorship (Force Expand)**: Forces the expansion of comments collapsed by keyword filters (`is_minimized_keywords = false`).
